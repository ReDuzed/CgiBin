# Not So CGI CgiBin

### What is this

To circumvent learning how to manage REBOL or PERL to output an image to a webpage this program simply uses PHP to send the running application data through sockets, waits until the image with the right ID is rendered, and then displays the image. Basically localhost sockets.

### What is here

The C# .NET 6.0-based program, and then the PHP script and consequent HTML page. This is set up to run a stats page currently.
